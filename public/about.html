<!--ABOUT ME-->
<div>
    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>I'm a mature student at the University of Aberdeen, studying Biological Sciences. 
        I'm an aspiring bioscience researcher who has had a love for the life sciences for as long as I can remember.
        Having started out in healthcare, I was later drawn to the topic of infectious disease, 
        then to microbiology, before finally finding my home in the field of evolutionary ecology and genomics, 
        especially in regards to insects, algae and marine life.
        My past experience in healthcare provided me many opportunities to acquire skills 
        to optimise studying and working in the biosciences - 
        assisting in the operating theatre at a prominent private hospital in Aberdeen for example
        required speedy problem solving, being able to think quickly on my feet in the face of adversity, 
        a firm respect for safety protocols, and an eagerness to assist my peers, learn and adapt.</p>

<h2>My Experience</h2>
    <h4>EastBio Research Experience Placement</h4>
    <h4>University of Aberdeen - Jun 2022-Aug 2022</h4>
    <p>My project was an investigation into phylosymbiosis - 
    the theory that the functional relationship between microbial communities and 
    host phenotypes should result in co-evolutionary patterns of phylogenetic divergence
    in the host and compositional divergence in the microbiome. 
    Corals, with their incredibly diverse microbial communities, made ideal models for phylosymbiosis.</p>
    <p>The project involved:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Acquiring 16S microbiome Illumina sequencing data and coral host COI barcode data 
                through the NCBI SRA and BOLD databases respectively.</li>
            <li>Using R-based workflows, DADA2 and phyloseq, to identify differences in microbiome diversity 
                and structure among hosts.</li>
            <li>Using MEGA11 software to create a host phylogenetic tree using COI barcodes.</li>
            <li>Testing for correspondence between microbiome divergence and host phylogeny.</li>
        </ul>  

    <h4>Healthcare Assistant</h4>
    <h4>BMI Albyn Hospital - Jan 2020-Jan 2022</h4>
    <p>In my time at Albyn Hospital, I worked in both the Outpatient department and the operating theatre.
        My responsibilities in the <b>operating theatre</b> were as follows:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Gather and set up equipment, tools and supplies and arrange instruments according to surgeons'
                preferences or instruction.</li>
            <li>Clean and sterilise instruments and surfaces and maintain supply inventories.</li>
            <li>Dispose of medical supplies and waste following strict health and safety guidelines</li>
            <li>Provide general scrubbing assistance and support to nurses and surgeons of a range of specialties.</li>
          </ul>  
    <p>My responsibilities in Outpatients were as follows:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Aid an inter-disciplinary team of consultants, physiotherapists and nurses by taking patient heights, weights,
                and allergies, and guiding patients when giving samples</li>
            <li>Ensure samples are handled properly, with the correct paperwork, and sent to the correct labs for testing.</li>
            <li>Handle highly confidential paperwork such as patient records, keeping them up to date and organised
                properly.</li>
        </ul>  

    <h4>Healthcare Support Worker</h4>
    <h4>NHS Grampian, Woodend Hospital - Nov 2018-Jan 2020</h4>
    <p>I worked in the Stroke Rehabilitation ward in Woodend Hospital, and performed a varied range of duties:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Assisted with patient hygiene, physical comfort, eating and drinking and mobility while observing and
                reporting specific changes.</li>
            <li>Observed patient skin conditions and reported findings to registered nurse</li>
            <li>Lifted patients using appropriate equipment in accordance with moving and handling policy.</li>
        </ul>
