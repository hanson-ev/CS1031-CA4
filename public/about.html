                    <h2>About Me</h2>
                    <p>I'm a mature student at the University of Aberdeen, studying Biological Sciences.
                        I'm an aspiring bioscience researcher who has had a love for the life sciences for as long as I
                        can remember.
                        Having started out in healthcare, I was later drawn to the topic of infectious disease,
                        then to microbiology, before finally finding my home in the field of evolutionary ecology and
                        genomics,
                        especially in regards to insects, algae and marine life.
                        My past experience in healthcare provided me many opportunities to acquire skills
                        to optimise studying and working in the biosciences -
                        assisting in the operating theatre at a prominent private hospital in Aberdeen for example
                        required speedy problem solving, being able to think quickly on my feet in the face of
                        adversity,
                        a firm respect for safety protocols, and an eagerness to assist my peers, learn and adapt.</p>

                        <p>My project was an investigation into phylosymbiosis -
                            the theory that the functional relationship between microbial communities and
                            host phenotypes should result in co-evolutionary patterns of phylogenetic divergence
                            in the host and compositional divergence in the microbiome.
                            Corals, with their incredibly diverse microbial communities, made ideal models for
                            phylosymbiosis.</p>
                        <p>The project involved:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Acquiring 16S microbiome Illumina sequencing data and coral host COI barcode data
                                through the NCBI SRA and BOLD databases respectively.</li>
                            <li>Using R-based workflows, DADA2 and phyloseq, to identify differences in microbiome
                                diversity
                                and structure among hosts.</li>
                            <li>Using MEGA11 software to create a host phylogenetic tree using COI barcodes.</li>
                            <li>Testing for correspondence between microbiome divergence and host phylogeny.</li>
                        </ul>
